  Octaudio-0.0.6.1 installation
  ===========================

- For any platform, working Octave installation is required. It is also highly recommended
  to install and load at least the 'signal' package for Octave.

- GNU/Linux. Pre-built binaries for Debian wheezy (Ocatve 3.6.2) and later (Octave 3.8.2)
  Debian distributions (both 32 and 64 bit) are available. These builds can also work
  on other GNU/Linux distributions with the corresponding Octave version installed.
  Download the appropriate deb package from Octaudio releases page, and install
  it with gdebi (recommended) or dpkg.
    sudo gdebi octaudio-0.0.6.1_amd64.deb
  or
    sudo dpkg --install octaudio-0.0.6.1_amd64.deb

- Mac OS X. Requirements:
    - Mac OS X 10 "Yosemite"
    - macports (https://www.macports.org)
    Install macports according to the instructions at https://www.macports.org/install.php.
    Install the following macports packages:
      sudo port install qt4-mac
      sudo port install portaudio
      sudo port install octave
      sudo port install octave-signal
    Download and unpack  octaudio-0.0.6.1-macosx.tar.gz archive from Octaudio releases page.

- Windows. Install official MXE Octave build from https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/windows.
  Download octaudio-0.0.6.1-mxe.zip archive from Octaudio releases page, and unpack it into
  octave-4.0.0 directory inside the Octave installation. Then you can run Octaudio with
  the octaudio.bat command file.

- For other platforms and/or Octave versions you will need to compile Octaudio from
  source.
