  Building Octaudio from source
  =============================

- Requirements

  - GNU Octave - http://www.gnu.org/software/octave
  - CMake - http://www.cmake.org
  - Qt4 - http://download.qt.io/archive/qt
  - Portaudio V19 - http://www.portaudio.com
  - libsamplerate - http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC

- General Instructions

  - Install dependencies.
  - Make sure that octave-config and qmake executables are in your path.
  - Create build directory
      mkdir build
      cd build
  - Start you favorite CMake interface
      cmake-gui /path/to/octaudio/source
  - Perform configuration. Locate all necessary paths if required.
  - Generate makefiles and close CMake.
  - Build
      make
      make install

- MS Windows note

  You should use the same (or compatible) compiler for all libraries (including Octave)
  and Octaudio itself. Thus if you want to use pre-compiled Octave binaries, you should
  use the corresponding compiler to build both Octaudio and all other libraries. For
  example, to build Octaudio for the MinGW Octave distribution, the
  Octave3.6.4_gcc4.6.2/mingw/bin/g++.exe compiler should be used.
