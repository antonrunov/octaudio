  Building Octaudio from source
  =============================

- Requirements

  - GNU Octave - http://www.gnu.org/software/octave
  - CMake - http://www.cmake.org
  - Qt5 - http://download.qt.io/archive/qt
  - Portaudio V19 - http://www.portaudio.com
  - libsamplerate - http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC
  - marked (optional), for generating html docs - https://github.com/chjj/marked

- General Instructions

  - Install dependencies.
  - Make sure that octave-config and qmake executables are in your path.
  - Create build directory
      mkdir build
      cd build
  - Start you favorite CMake interface
      cmake-gui /path/to/octaudio/source
  - Perform configuration. Locate all necessary paths if required.
  - Generate makefiles and close CMake.
  - Build
      make
      make install
  - Please note that the installation step is required for working Octaudio setup.
    Otherwise Octaudio will not be able to find its startup script and some components.

- Building for MS Windows

  There are two ways to build Octaudio for Windows. The first is a cross-compilation with
  MXE-Octave toolchain which is also an official way to build Octave binaries for Windows.
  The second way is to compile Octaudio natively on Windows with the mingw
  compiler bundled with Octave binary distribution.

  Almost all required libraries binaries (except libsamplerate) are bundled with
  Octave-4.x distribution and can be just used for buiding Octaudio, but one still needs
  to build Qt4 to get the qmake utility.

  - Using MXE-Octave
    - See http://wiki.octave.org/Windows_Installer for instructions to set up
      MXE-Octave toolchain.
    - It is not necessary to build the whole Octave target as one can use pre-compiled
      libraries from Octave distribution. But you need to build at least qt and libsamplerate.
    - Use usr/i686-w64-mingw32/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake file as CMake toolchain file
      and specify custom qt variables (replace /PATH_TO_MXE/ below with the actual path)
        cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/PATH_TO_MXE/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake \
              -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=/PATH_TO_MXE/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-qmake \
              -DQT_MOC_EXECUTABLE=/PATH_TO_MXE/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-moc \
              -DQT_UIC_EXECUTABLE=/PATH_TO_MXE/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-uic \
              -DQT_RCC_EXECUTABLE=/PATH_TO_MXE/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-rcc ...
    - Buld Octaudio according to the general instructions above.

  - To build natively you need to compile Qt4 and libsamplerate with the
    i686-w64-mingw32-gcc compiler bundled with Octave. Then you can build Octaudio with
    the same compiler following the general instructions above.
